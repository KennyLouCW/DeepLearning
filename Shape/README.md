# DeepLearning<br />
shape.zip contains the training data which are circles, squares, stars and triangles<br />
cnn.py file: I use convolutional neural networks to identify the shapes<br />
nn.py file: I use neural networks to identify the shapes<br />
<br />
In the above .py files, I use Pytorch to assist me building the model.
